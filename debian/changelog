    of using apt-get update / apt-get install --allow-unauthenticated (which
    method doesn't work anymore in Buster).
  * Set haproxy's nbproc to 4 by default for swiftproxy, compute and
    controller nodes.
  * Copy the backport repository key file inside the targets instead of using
    the openstack-backports-archive-keyring package, which doesn't work anymore

    - Correctly check for $mgmt_net["iface2"] and not $onenet when calculating
      --static-iface.

    ordering was broken).
    - Correctly set the erlang_cookie for rabbitmq as a random value.
    - Correctly use a a real random key for heat's encryption key.
    - Correct swift pipeline order when using encryption.

    services connecting always to the same host.
  * Add support for Cinder volume over Ceph.
  * Provision Ceph OSD using bluestore.
  * Fix poc-bin/oci-poc-setup-bodi-hook motd.

    - Add a machine-set, to select /var/lib/nova/instances on Ceph or not.
    - Modify the ENC to transmit the use_ceph_if_available variable.
    - Modify compute manifest to use the use_ceph_if_available and possibly use
      Ceph or not for /var/lib/nova/instances.
